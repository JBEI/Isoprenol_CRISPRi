This repository contains code and results for applying the [Automated Recommendation Tool](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18008-4) to identify optimal CRISPRi combinations to increase isoprenol production in P. Putida. This project is in collaboration with David Carruthers and Taek Soon Lee. 

In each DBTL round, David has created CRISPRi strains and measured their isoprenol titer and proteomics.
